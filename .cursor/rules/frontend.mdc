When working in the app/components directory and component files:

Always use Tailwind for styling
Always use Typescript
Always create an Typescript Interface and apply it to the component to descrive the props that will recieve
When the types/interface definition on the component becomes ~50 lines long pull it into it's own file following the patter [component name].types.ts 
Always use functional components
Always decostruct the component props so they are visible on the component function definition
Always start component with capital letter and use camel case for component, file and folder levels
Follow component naming conventions
